# FleaFestivalDifficulty

Are the flea festival games too hard? Too easy? Well now you can adjust the game difficulties!

## Usage
To change the speed of fleas and the scores required to beat the champion/seth,
hit `F1` to open BepInEx Configuration Manager, then navigate to `FleaFestivalDifficulty`.

You can then change the multipliers for each individual game.
The higher the multiplier, the higher the score or the faster the feas.

For speed multipliers, you'll need to leave and re-enter the room for the values to apply.
I'd like to fix this in the future, so stay tuned for an update.
